## Reusable Models
Models trained with DKPro TC are not usable as independent components in pipelines, yet.
We thus can't take advantage of once created models.
In order to make trained TC models reusable, the necessary TC related components have to be deployed together with the model wrapped into a prediction-mode component.

I see essentially 3 stages of TC model reusability

### Stage 1 (TC/DKPro reusable)
Progress: 80%

Trained models can be used within a TC pipeline in a developing environment.
This is largely achieved.

Solved points:
  * dealing with absolute file paths
  * User defined features have to be provided (solved as in: copy them over by hand)

Open points are:
  * No version awareness if feature XY is needed and it is found in the classpath/workspace it is taken (feature might have changed between TC versions ...,0.6, 0.7) this might lead to unintended side-effects / different results which are extremely hard to track from the user perspective
  * How to auto-install models locally or at least semi-automatically 
  * Provide guides (by example code) of how to load/use the installed model in a minimal working example/annotator
  * Ship recommended preprocessing information which can yet be turned off (e.g. ArkTagger should be used with ArkTokenizer)


*REC* Let us assume we establish a best-practice as follows for TC experiments:

  * experiments consist of two Maven projects: 
    # *experiment code * - containing the experimental setup
    # *runtime code* - containing any parts of the experimental setup that are required when using a generated model, e.g. custom feature extractors.
  * additionally, models are packaged in a Maven artifact
  * the model artifact has a dependency on the runtime artifact from above

So when somebody adds a TC model to a Maven project, the runtime code with the custom feature extractors is automatically added as well.

### Stage 2 (standalone application )
Progress: 0%

It is possible to create a standalone component that can be provided free of any developer environment to 3rd parties to release an actual product of something
e.g. 
{{{java -jar myExperiment.jar 'param1' 'param2' }}}

This one might become trivial once stage 2 is cleared
