## Recommended Practices for Commit Messages

The following recommendations come from http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/IssueTracker#Integration_with_version_control[Google Code]:

It is helpful if code revisions are linked with the Issue that they address.  You can easily create this link by the format of your Commit message.

A Google Code commit message can contain up to three parts: 
   # the commit notes: a summary of the revision
   # (Newline, then) the Issue ID and any changes to the issue (update, fix/close, change of labels, etc.)
   # a message to be posted to the Issue

### Sample Commit Messages


.Commit Message #1
----
Change the validation routines to also accept unicode string. And,
speeds up that O(N^2) comparison.

Update issue 99998
The performance and internationalization aspects of this issue have
been handled.  The remaining part of the issue has a clear work-around
and only affects a small number of users, so it is less important to fix.
----

.Commit Message #2
----
Change the validation routines to also accept unicode string. And,
speeds up that O(N^2) comparison.

New issue
Summary: Update and translate end-user docs on validation
Owner: johnsmith@gmail.com
Labels: Component-Documentation
Now that we accept input in more languages, we should translate the on-line
help for that part of the application.
----

.Commit Message #3_ (Will open and close an issue all at once)
----
Bug in ngram feature extractor throws exception if stopword file is empty.

New issue
Summary: Empty stopword file throws exception
Owner: johnsmith@gmail.com
Status: Fixed
Labels: Priority-Medium
When stopword file is empty, an exception was thrown.  Instead, now, it creates an empty list.
----

### Shortcuts to close an Issue

For just closing an issue (i.e., not otherwise modifying it), a "fixes" phrase can be used anywhere in the commit notes:

.Commit Message #4
----
Change the validation routines to also accept unicode string. And,
speeds up that O(N^2) comparison.

Fixes issue 99998
Fixes issue 99999
----

.Commit Message #5
----
Fixes issue 998.  Change the validation routines to also accept unicode string. And,
speeds up that O(N^2) comparison.
----

.Commit Message #6
----
(Fixes issue 998)  Change the validation routines to also accept unicode string. And,
speeds up that O(N^2) comparison.
