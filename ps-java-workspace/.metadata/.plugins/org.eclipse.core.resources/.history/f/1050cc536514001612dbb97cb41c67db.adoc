## How to setup Groovy in your IDE

### Introduction

We provide example TC experiments in Java and Groovy. In order to use the Groovy examples and to define your own experiments in Groovy, you have to perform a few steps to prepare your Eclipse installation.

### Eclipse Setup

  * Install the Groovy-Eclipse plugin via the Eclipse marketplace or from any of https://github.com/groovy/groovy-eclipse/wiki[the update sites]. This gives you the Groovy capabilities needed for running and writing Groovy experiments.
  * Make sure that you install support for the Groovy compiler 2.1
  * If you use Maven to build your projects (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED), install the Groovy-Eclipse "configurator for m2eclipse" using any of https://github.com/groovy/groovy-eclipse/wiki/Groovy-Eclipse-Maven-plugin[the update sites].
