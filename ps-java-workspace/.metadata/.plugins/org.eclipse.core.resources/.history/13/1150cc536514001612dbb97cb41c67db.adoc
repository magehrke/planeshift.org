## How to set up a DKPro-TC reader

_This tutorial refers to the 0.6.0-Release of DKPro TC._

### Creating a reader for your data

For reference, you should have a look at the readers of the `io` package in the `de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.tc.examples-gpl` module.

### Minimal requirements

All DKPro-TC readers should implement either `TCReaderSingleLabel` (single-label classification and regression experiments) or `TCReaderMultiLabel` (multi-label classification experiments).

A reader in DKPro-TC needs to define at least:

* the structure of the UIMA CAS (i.e. the document text)
* the classification outcome (i.e. the class labels of the document)

### Reusing DKPro Core readers

You can re-use most readers from the `io` modules of https://dkpro.github.io/dkpro-core[DKPro Core], which contain readers for different simple data formats such as TXT or HTML, but also readers for popular data collections, e.g. the BNC.
If your DKPro-TC reader inherits from a DKPro Core reader, you don't have to care about the structure of the CAS, but only need to additionally specify the `getTextClassificationOutcome()`. The latter sets the document labels.

### Building a customized reader

Imagine the following simple data structure:

[source,java]
----
This is the first sentence.  ----  sentence_found
It is the second one.        ----  sentence_missing
The third sentence.          ----  sentence_found
----

In `de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.tc.examples-gpl/src/main/resources/data/simple_reader`, you will find two TXT files corresponding to this structure: the first consists of documents (here: sentences) to be classified and the second of the corresponding labels. The label `sentence_found` means that sentence is containing the word "sentence", the label `sentence_missing` means the opposite of that: the sentence does not contain the word "sentence". 

We now describe a simple customized reader for the above data structure. You can use this reader a basis for your own customized reader.
The reader is named `SimpleDkproTCReader` and can be found in `de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.tc.examples.io`. It inherits from `JCasResourceCollectionReader_ImplBase` and implements `TCReaderSingleLabel` (as described in the first section). The following functions are relevant and may or may not have to be overwritten:

[source,java]
----
initialize(UimaContext context)
----

This reads the initial data and stores it in appropriate data structure(s), e.g. lists of all texts and labels.

[source,java]
----
hasNext()
----

If this method returns true, `getNext()` will be called, i.e. a new CAS (document) is created. This method usually iterates over the data structure created during `initialize(UimaContext context)`.

[source,java]
----
getNext(JCas aJCas)
----

Here, we need to:

* set metadata (as we are creating more than one CAS out of a single file, we need to have different document titles and URIs for each CAS, otherwise serialized CASes will be overwritten), 
* set document text (a sentence in this case),
* set outcome (labels)

[source,java]
----
getTextClassificationOutcome(JCas jcas) 
----

This method has to return the classification outcome (the responding label for this jcas).

The demo which reuses `SimpleDkproTCReader` can be started with `SimpleDkproTCReaderDemo` in the package `de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.tc.examples.single.document`.
