[To] Jashoky Dakarn

[NPC Internal] Is there something I can do?
[NPC Narrate] -Jashoky turns a jar upside down and shakes it.-
[NPC] Jashoky: Aghh, no more seeds.
[NPC Narrate] -Jashoky looks at you.-
[NPC] Jashoky: Hmmm, greetings.
[NPC] Jashoky: Did I hear aright, are you looking for a job?
[NPC Internal] Yes, I want to help.
[NPC Narrate] -Jashoky smiles broadly.-
[NPC] Jashoky: That's just grand!
[NPC Narrate] -Jashoky looks at the jar then back at you.-
[NPC] Jashoky: I've done run out of Corium seeds.
[NPC Narrate] -Jashoky lifts the jar slightly, as if showing how empty it is.-
[NPC] Jashoky: Would you be so kind as to find me another jar?
[NPC Narrate] -Jashoky removes a bag from her apron and shakes it in front of you. The sound of coins hitting one another resounds from the bag.-
[NPC] Jashoky: I can for sure pay you for 'em.
[NPC Internal] Yes, any ideas where I can start.
[NPC Narrate] -Jashoky bobs her head with happiness and returns the bag to her apron.-
[NPC] Jashoky: That just about makes my day, Sir.
[NPC] Jashoky: I believe there's a merchant in the wilds that sells them.
[NPC] Jashoky: If I remember rightly, kra is usually close to Hydlaa.
[NPC Internal] Can you tell me more about this merchant?
[NPC Narrate] -Jashoky looks up at the dome a moment.-
[NPC] Jashoky: Grokâ€¦
[NPC] Jashoky: I think kra said.
[NPC] Jashoky: I'm sure you can find kra.
[NPC] Jashoky: It ain't like the road to Hydlaa is full up with kran merchants or somethin'.
[NPC Narrate] -Jashoky smiles happily.-
[NPC Internal] I have the seeds.
[NPC Narrate] -Jashoky takes the jar and opens it up, picking out one seed and inspecting it. After some time she returns the seed to the jar.-
[NPC] Jashoky: Mighty kind of you, Stonehammer.
[NPC] Jashoky: These are for the seeds and your time.
[NPC Narrate] -Jashoky removes a few coins from the bag.-
[NPC] Jashoky: If you ever pass by again, please feel free to come 'round.
[NPC] Jashoky: I might need your help again.
