[To] Pinayet Ullavin

[NPC Internal] Do you happen to have any more work for me?
[NPC] Pinayet: Gracious, yes!
[NPC] Pinayet: I could use some help again, if you could use a few tria.
[NPC] Pinayet: Would you be willing to find something out for me?
[NPC Internal] It would be my pleasure.
[NPC] Pinayet: I'm glad to hear that.
[NPC] Pinayet: You see, my family lives on the Far Ground, and I send them letters pretty regular-like.
[NPC] Pinayet: That is, I did until the messenger I used got married and moved off.
[NPC] Pinayet: Now, I don't know who to use.
[NPC] Pinayet: Could you maybe ask Jirosh Mikana which messenger he uses?
[NPC] Pinayet: He's a big merchant and sends things all over Yliakum, so he must know of someone.
[NPC] Pinayet: Here, take my letter for my family and give it to the messenger when you find him.
[NPC] Pinayet: When the messenger has the letter, just come back and tell me that you are all done, and I'll get you your payment.
[NPC Narrate] -Pinayet hands you a tidily folded letter.-

[To] Jirosh Mikana

[NPC Internal] Do you know of any trustworthy messengers I could use?
[NPC] Jirosh: Oh, I use Tarela Girshon for sending such things as promises of payment and contracts.
[NPC] Jirosh: She's quick and reliable.
[NPC] Jirosh: I believe she's in Hydlaa right now, if you need her services.
[NPC] Jirosh: Just ask her to deliver your letter and she'll be off before you know it.

[To] Tarela Girshon

[NPC Internal] I'd like you to deliver a letter for me.
[NPC] Tarela: I'd be happy to do that, Maddam.
[NPC] Tarela: I need to know the recipient's name and which level they are on so I can charge you properly.
[NPC] Tarela: What is the recipient's last name?
[NPC Internal] The family name is Ullavin.
[NPC Narrate] -Tarela appears to think for a moment.-
[NPC] Tarela: Yesâ€¦that name sounds familiar.
[NPC] Tarela: What level?
[NPC Internal] They are on the third level.
[NPC] Tarela: My fee will be seventy five tria.
[NPC Narrate] -Tarela holds out a paw.-
[NPC Internal] Here is your fee.
[NPC] Tarela: Thank you.
[NPC] Tarela: I'll take that letter now.
[NPC Narrate] -Tarela looks at you expectantly.-
[NPC Internal] Here you go. Safe journey.
[NPC] Tarela: I should have this delivered shortly.
[NPC] Tarela: I appreciate the business.

[To] Pinayet Ullavin

[NPC Internal] Your letter is on its way.
[NPC Narrate] -Pinayet smiles broadly.-
[NPC] Pinayet: Well, that's a relief.
[NPC] Pinayet: What was the name of the messenger, so I can use him again?
[NPC Internal] SHE is called Tarela Girshon.
[NPC] Pinayet: Oh, thank you!
[NPC] Pinayet: You said Tarela?
[NPC] Pinayet: Yes, I know her.
[NPC] Pinayet: I guess I should not have said to give -him- the letter.
[NPC Narrate] -Pinayet laughs.-
[NPC] Pinayet: You have been a big help.
[NPC] Pinayet: Please, take your reward and many thanks!
[NPC Narrate] -Pinayet hands you a few coins.-
