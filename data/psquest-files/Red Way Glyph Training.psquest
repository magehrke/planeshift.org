[To] Ferryd Shillor

[NPC Internal] Please accept my wand as being a worthy student.
[NPC Narrate] -Ferryd holds a hand up.-
[NPC] Ferryd: Not so fast.
[NPC] Ferryd: Welcome back YOU.
[NPC] Ferryd: I sense that your Red Way skills have progressed nicely.
[NPC] Ferryd: Are you ready for learning about spells which require a single glyph?
[NPC Internal] Yes, I come prepared.
[NPC] Ferryd: Good, let me think.
[NPC Narrate] -Ferryd taps his chin with his fore finger, then snaps his fingers.-
[NPC] Ferryd: I know, give meâ€¦
[NPC] Ferryd: No, you should hand be your Wand as proof of being a 'worthy student'.
[NPC Internal] My wand, as requested.
[NPC] Ferryd: Great.
[NPC Narrate] -Ferryd plays with the wand as he continues to speak.-

[NPC Narrate] -Ferryd awaits the glyph.-

[Give] Ferryd Shillor; 1, Vortex Glyph

[NPC Internal] Would that be .. this one?
[NPC Narrate] -Ferryd nods.-
[NPC] Ferryd: Yes, Vortex is the correct Glyph.
[NPC] Ferryd: You have met with Meoeor, I assume.
[NPC] Ferryd: Such an impatient fellow, he is.
[NPC] Ferryd: When I met him, he always seemed to think there was a shorter route to his desires, and never stopped to think about the gains of the longer path.
[NPC] Ferryd: When studying magic, you may miss important experiences if you do not go slowly.
[NPC] Ferryd: Not to mention the dangers of pushing yourself.
[NPC Narrate] -Ferryd looks you over once before continuing.-
[NPC] Ferryd: Now, let's see what else you have learned.
[NPC] Ferryd: There is a Glyph that enhances your strength for a short time.
[NPC] Ferryd: Do you possess one?
[NPC Internal] I do.
[NPC] Ferryd: Good.
[NPC] Ferryd: Then please show it to me.

[Give] Ferryd Shillor; 1, Might Glyph

[NPC Internal] Here is the second glyph you requested.
[NPC Narrate] -Ferryd grins.-
[NPC] Ferryd: Yes, indeed.
[NPC] Ferryd: I once used it on a small lemur girl and had a test of strength challenge with some of the strongest Kran.
[NPC] Ferryd: They, however had no idea.
[NPC] Ferryd: You should have seen them, their embarrassment almost turned them into red ruby Kran.
[NPC Narrate] -Ferryd laughs uncontrollable for a while before wiping the tears from his eyes.-
[NPC] Ferryd: Congratulations YOU, you know have the knowledge and Glyphs needed to proceed past this stage of training.
[NPC] Ferryd: I give you these bracers as proof, and with then you can go by the title of Low Apprentice.
[NPC] Ferryd: After you have trained your skills further, you will return them to me and I will test you once again.
