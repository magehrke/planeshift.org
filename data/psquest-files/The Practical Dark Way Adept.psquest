[To] Rulayne Ogrin

[NPC Internal] Please except my Way Wand as proof of being a worthy student.
[NPC] Rulayne: Your dedication astounds me, YOU.
[NPC] Rulayne: Not to mention the fact that you still live.
[NPC] Rulayne: Rather disappointing, but who am I to question the will of Dakkru?
[NPC Narrate] -Rulayne hands back the wand, shaking his head.-
[NPC] Rulayne: It is nearly time for you to begin your Master level testing.
[NPC] Rulayne: First, you will travel to the Eagle Bronze Doors.
[NPC] Rulayne: Zhaomal of the Shadowcasters need to be taught a lesson in a Dark Way matter.
[NPC] Rulayne: Let him know you are there toâ€¦
[NPC] Rulayne: help.
[NPC Narrate] -Rulayne mask grins.-

[To] Zhaomal Shehan

[NPC Internal] I was told you needed help.
[NPC] Zhaomal: You are much too good looking to be Rulayne.
[NPC] Zhaomal: That mask must hide a face only a mother could bare.
[NPC Narrate] -Zhaomal laughs before looking at you with some curiosity.-
[NPC] Zhaomal: Let's see what you know.
[NPC] Zhaomal: I have a young Shadowcaster residing in Sarpendil who is a very competent messenger.
[NPC] Zhaomal: He is the fastest foot to either the Eagle Bronze Door or Hydlaa, and stakes his day's pay on making the trip in short time than anyone else can.
[NPC] Zhaomal: In saying that, he noticed that every time he makes a delivery to Dark Wanderer, he is exhausted on the way back and needs many rest stops before returning.
[NPC Narrate] -Zhaomal taps his chin.-
[NPC] Zhaomal: So, he keeps losing out every time he delivers for the Wanderer.
[NPC] Zhaomal: The Wanderer has admitted to using a Dark Way spell, and that he will repay all lost delivery fees we can tell what spell or glyph combination is used.
[NPC] Zhaomal: So Sir Dark Way Adept, what do you suggest is the spell or combine that overwhelms the poor messenger so?
[NPC Internal] Illness and Weakness Glyphs.
[NPC Narrate] -Zhaomal nods while thinking.-
[NPC] Zhaomal: That would do it.
[NPC Narrate] -Zhaomal removes a hand full of glyphs from his glyph sack, then sorts out three of them.-
[NPC] Zhaomal: It seems I have an extra glyph here.
[NPC] Zhaomal: Even I do not need more than one of each glyph.
[NPC Narrate] -Zhaomal shakes his head.-
[NPC] Zhaomal: You know what, you may have this glyph for sharing your knowledge.
[NPC] Zhaomal: Perhaps you will consider joining the Shadowcasters in time.
[NPC] Zhaomal: You do not need to join now, nor do I think you have enough talent.
[NPC] Zhaomal: For that, you must achieve Adept status in all Way Circles, and Master in none.
[NPC] Zhaomal: I only ask you consider it if that time comes.
[NPC] Zhaomal: One more thing.
[NPC] Zhaomal: Do say thank you to Rulayne for sending such a talented Enkidukai.

[To] Rulayne Ogrin

[NPC Internal] Zhaomal sends thanks.
[NPC] Rulayne: He does, does he?
[NPC] Rulayne: He thanks me for giving him another prospect is all.
[NPC] Rulayne: Your 'talents' were likely wasted on a problem he already had the solution to.
[NPC] Rulayne: The Shadowcasters are always looking for the most talented practitioners in all six Ways to join them.
[NPC Narrate] -Rulayne shrugs.-
[NPC] Rulayne: That is your choice to make.
[NPC] Rulayne: Perhaps his ways will kill you faster than mine.
[NPC] Rulayne: One can only hope.
[NPC] Rulayne: The robe you carry belongs to an apprentice, which you are clearly no longer.
[NPC] Rulayne: Give it to me now.
[NPC Internal] My robe as requested, sir.
[NPC] Rulayne: Yes, you will no longer use this robe.
[NPC Narrate] -Rulayne tosses it to the ground and steps on it.-
[NPC] Rulayne: I must ask you one last question.
[NPC] Rulayne: This one is very important, as it will affect what you choose to do next.
[NPC] Rulayne: Tell me what Way directly opposes the Dark Way.
[NPC Internal] Crystal Way.
[NPC] Rulayne: Correct again.
[NPC] Rulayne: You have proven your knowledge of the Dark Way to me.
[NPC] Rulayne: I am no longer embarrassed to present you with your new robe, Adept of the Dark Way.
[NPC Narrate] -Rulayne hands you a neatly folded robe.-
[NPC] Rulayne: As I mentioned, I am sure Zhaomal tried to convince you to consider joining the Shadowcasters.
[NPC] Rulayne: Your last chance to do so will soon be upon you.
[NPC] Rulayne: Take your new robe and show it to Londris.
[NPC] Rulayne: He will tell you of the choices you have to make.

[To] Londris Kolaim

[NPC Internal] Please except my Way Robe as proof of being a worthy student.
[NPC Narrate] -Londris speaks without looking at you, his attention absorbed by one of his books.-
[NPC] Londris: Rulayne has approved of you?
[NPC] Londris: Well then, you think it is time for you to speak to her, don't you?
[NPC] Londris: Well, you can't.
[NPC] Londris: She has no time for those that are not completely devoted to the Dark Way Circle.
[NPC] Londris: A choice is now before you.
[NPC] Londris: This is the last test before you will no longer be allowed to change your chosen Way of study.
[NPC] Londris: If you continue on the path to Mastery in the Dark Way Circle, you will not be able to advance beyond apprentice level in the Crystal Way Circle.
[NPC] Londris: You will not be able to advance beyond low Adept in the Azure and Blue way Circles.
[NPC] Londris: You will not be allowed to advance to Master level in Red and Brown Way Circles.
[NPC] Londris: Do you understand this?
[NPC Internal] Yes, be careful of mixing with opposing magic.
[NPC] Londris: Very well.
[NPC] Londris: If your wishes bring you to follow the Dark Way to full mastery, you will need to finish your training to the extent of Rulayne's abilities.
[NPC] Londris: Then you may come to me and give me your wand together with another Adept's Dark Way Wand and one Apprentice's Dark Way Wand, which also may be borrowed from a fellow student.
[NPC] Londris: This is to prove you have gained the respect and trust of your Adept peers, as well as the Apprentices.
[NPC] Londris: Remember, once you bring these three wands to me, there will be no turning back.
[NPC] Londris: Think long and hard before you make this choice, YOU.
