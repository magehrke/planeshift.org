[To] Thorian Gronk

[NPC Internal] So, do you have anything a Enkidukai like myself can do?
[NPC] Thorian: Oh, it's you, NAME.
[NPC] Thorian: Your name has been passed around the mercantile district lately.
[NPC] Thorian: I think I can count on a Enkidukai like you to help me with some business.
[NPC] Thorian: If you say yes my competition, say someone like Jirosh, he won't like it and will not let you work for his syndicate.
[NPC] Thorian: And to sweeten the pot, I'll even make sure you get access to the Winch area.
[NPC Narrate] -Thorian licks his lips.-
[NPC] Thorian: Is that a sweet enough fruit for you?
[NPC Internal] Sounds as good as a freshly baked Apple pie.
[NPC] Thorian: Ah, wonderful.
[NPC] Thorian: The merchants from the lower levels have been charging insufferable prices for far too long.
[NPC] Thorian: It's time for us to begin to treat them in kind.
[NPC] Thorian: I'm proposing a merchant syndicate dedicated to price collusion and maximum profit.
[NPC Narrate] -Thorian rubs his hands together.-
[NPC] Thorian: All you have to do is collect some personal merchant seals.
[NPC] Thorian: These seals are different colours to show a merchants allegiance to various syndicates.
[NPC] Thorian: For example, mine is very dark shade of grey, black you might even say.
[NPC Narrate] -Thorian pauses a bit, before nosily clearing his throat preparing to explain further.-
[NPC] Thorian: I need five black seals to make it official.
[NPC] Thorian: Ask any of the merchants in Hydlaa, Ojaveda, Gugrontid or that Klyros city to join the me.
[NPC] Thorian: Use any means: coercion, bribery, deception, anything.
[NPC] Thorian: Oh, and -don't- talk to Jirosh Mikana about this syndicate.
[NPC] Thorian: I'll be waiting round here somewhere for the black seals.

[To] Kaiman Jilatt

[NPC Internal] Hi, do you want to join a Merchant's Syndicate?
[NPC Narrate] -Kaiman looks you over as he stands sack in hand.-
[NPC] Kaiman: Are you here on behalf of Thorian?
[NPC Internal] Yes it's for Thorian's Syndicate.
[NPC] Kaiman: He sent you?
[NPC] Kaiman: Great, I wonder what he promised you?
[NPC Narrate] -Kaiman digs about in one of the many sacs he has with him.-
[NPC] Kaiman: Here we go, you can have this seal.
[NPC Narrate] -Kaiman pauses before handing the seal over.-
[NPC] Kaiman: You know, I'm very interested in this syndicate.
[NPC] Kaiman: I didn't move up from the Far Ground for reasons other than profit.
[NPC Narrate] -Kaiman winks and waits.-
[NPC Internal] Would a Circle help?
[NPC Narrate] -Kaiman tosses the seal at NAME.-
[NPC] Kaiman: Yes, here you go.

[To] Boralis Voladrand

[NPC Internal] Hello, would you like to join a Merchant Syndicate?
[NPC] Boralis: A syndicate, you say?
[NPC] Boralis: Let me say that I don't trust the Mikana Company at all, so don't even try to convince me to join them.
[NPC] Boralis: As for Thorian, I'm not sure about an alliance with him, but a few circles might change my mind.
[NPC Internal] It's a good thing I'm here on behalf of Thorian then, isn't it.
[NPC Narrate] -Boralis takes the coin and quickly pockets it.-
[NPC] Boralis: Thank you.
[NPC] Boralis: It's been a pleasure.
[NPC] Boralis: And this is for you.

[To] Rinna Voladrand

[NPC Internal] Would you like to join a Merchant Syndicate?
[NPC] Rinna: Have you spoken to my husband about this already?
[NPC Internal] Yes, I have.
[NPC Narrate] -Rinna nods with a smile on her face.-
[NPC] Rinna: Well I do have a personal merchant seal, truth be told, but I will let him speak for both of us.
[NPC] Rinna: Thank you for asking me though.

[To] Yonda Axebow

[NPC Internal] Do you want to join a Merchant Syndicate?
[NPC] Yonda: A syndicate?
[NPC] Yonda: I'd never thought about it.
[NPC Narrate] -Yonda stands with her hands on her hips and looks up thoughtfully.-
[NPC] Yonda: Yes, I think it's a good idea.
[NPC] Yonda: I will join a single syndicate.
[NPC] Yonda: Who do you represent?
[NPC Internal] The NAME Trading company.
[NPC Narrate] -Yonda laughs.-
[NPC] Yonda: I guess that would be you then.
[NPC] Yonda: I somehow don't think youâ€™re serious, who is it really?
[NPC Internal] Thorian Gronk's syndicate.
[NPC] Yonda: Alright, you tell this Thorian person that I'd be happy to join.
[NPC] Yonda: And I'll colour this wax black, and here's my seal.

[To] Edrich Sultov

[NPC Internal] Will you join Thorian's Merchant Syndicate?
[NPC] Edrich: I hope to one day form my own syndicate, so right now, I shall not be joining any.
[NPC] Edrich: Thanks all the same.
[NPC Narrate] -Edrich pauses before saying.-
[NPC] Edrich: However, for five hundred Tria I could give you a forged merchant seal.
[NPC Narrate] -Edrich holds out a hand.-
[NPC] Edrich: If that interests you?
[NPC Internal] That's too much for a fake!
[NPC] Edrich: It's too bad you think that.
[NPC] Edrich: It's two circles or nothing.
[NPC Internal] Fine then, here is your Tria.
[NPC] Edrich: Good choice.
[NPC] Edrich: Here you go.

[To] Ervin Fromaad

[NPC Internal] Hi, are you interested in joining a Merchant Syndicate?
[NPC] Ervin: I'm always interested in joining syndicates.
[NPC] Ervin: I'm already a member of several.
[NPC] Ervin: Who are you representing?
[NPC Internal] Thorian Gronk.
[NPC] Ervin: Thorian, really.
[NPC] Ervin: Sounds like a good opportunity to make some profit.
[NPC] Ervin: You can take this to him.

[To] Thorian Gronk

[NPC Internal] I've collected all the seals you needed.
[NPC] Thorian: You've done it!
[NPC] Thorian: HA!
[NPC] Thorian: Did you manage to get any extra?
[NPC Internal] I only got the five you asked for.
[NPC] Thorian: Very good, I knew I could count on you, NAME.
[NPC Narrate] -Thorian beaded face smiles.-
[NPC] Thorian: Congratulations, you're now an honorary member of Thorian Gronk's merchant syndicate.
[NPC] Thorian: And as promised with all mercantile winch access privileges.
[NPC] Thorian: Give this paper to Percival Hawthorne.
[NPC] Thorian: He ought to let you enter the winch from then on.
[NPC] Thorian: Thanks again.
