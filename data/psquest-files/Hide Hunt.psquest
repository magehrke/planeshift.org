[To] Bjorid Haakthir

[NPC Internal] You look busy. Is there anything I can do to help?
[NPC] Bjorid: Hmm, well let's see.
[NPC Narrate] -Bjorid looks around quickly then nods.-
[NPC] Bjorid: I'm in need of some hides for a new batch of carpets.
[NPC] Bjorid: You up to the challenge of helping me get some?
[NPC] Bjorid: There'll be some tria in it for you if so!
[NPC Internal] Tell me what you need.
[NPC] Bjorid: Ah, that is good to hear, so wellâ€¦
[NPC Narrate] -He starts to look you over.-
[NPC] Bjorid: You look like you can fight.
[NPC] Bjorid: Do you think you could go and do some hunting for me?
[NPC Internal] Which hides do you need?
[NPC] Bjorid: I have a certain customer who needs very hardwearing and rough looking fur for his carpets.
[NPC] Bjorid: It seems an odd choice to me, but who am I to question it?
[NPC] Bjorid: If you are up for it, you can bring me two vilenaut furs for me to use.
[NPC Internal] Here are your furs.
[NPC] Bjorid: Ahh, there you are!
[NPC] Bjorid: Let's see what you have here.
[NPC Narrate] -He stops to inspect the furs, grins and then passes you a few coins.-
[NPC] Bjorid: This will keep me busy for a little while.
[NPC] Bjorid: Thank you!
