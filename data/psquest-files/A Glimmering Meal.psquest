[To] Boilghere

[NPC Internal] Is there something you need help with?
[NPC Narrate] -Boilghere observes you for a moment. From time to time he clenches his hands, as if trying to grasp something.-
[NPC] Boilghere: If you come to help, then you come at the right time.
[NPC Narrate] -Boilghere hand rubs his mouth with a quiet scraping sound.-
[NPC] Boilghere: I was about to prepare a meal, but it troubles my mind what sort of crystal should I use for that.
[NPC] Boilghere: Same meal each day does not make a good cook.
[NPC] Boilghere: I need something new.
[NPC] Boilghere: I need something refreshing, like a breeze blowing from another place.
[NPC Narrate] -Boilghere entwines his hands, keeping them together firmly.-
[NPC] Boilghere: If you bring me a rare gem, surely there will be a reward.
[NPC] Boilghere: Will you try to find one for me?
[NPC Internal] Of course I'll help you!
[NPC] Boilghere: Then go and bring me what you find.
[NPC Narrate] -Boilghere rubs his mouth.-
[NPC] Boilghere: Remember that the gem has to be rare.

[NPC Internal] Well, I do have this, will it work?
[NPC] Boilghere: What is this?
[NPC Narrate] -Boilghere inspects the crystal.-
[NPC] Boilghere: A Green Jasper Crystal!
[NPC] Boilghere: I haven't seen one of those for a very long time.
[NPC Narrate] -Boilghere rubs his mouth again.-
[NPC] Boilghere: Yes, yes.
[NPC] Boilghere: This one will do.
[NPC] Boilghere: Now I only need to recall how to prepare itâ€¦
[NPC Narrate] -Boilghere turns his head in your direction.-
[NPC] Boilghere: I promised you a reward, yes, I know.
[NPC] Boilghere: Here you go.
