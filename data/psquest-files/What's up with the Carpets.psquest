[Need] [Quest] Repair Mulgik's Bracers

[To] Brintec Dev-Onni

[NPC Internal] Hail, I am looking for some adventure, a quest of sorts.
[NPC] Brintec: I'm a merchant my friend.
[NPC] Brintec: I sell things, I don't have exciting jobs for adventure-seekers.
[NPC] Brintec: But since you've mentioned it, yes, there is something you can do for me.
[NPC] Brintec: I have to fill a big order, a rich customer from Hydlaa wants new carpets, all in blue color.
[NPC] Brintec: The weaver was supposed to deliver the carpets yesterday, but he did not.
[NPC] Brintec: You can find him and tell him I really need the carpets.
[NPC] Brintec: He should be in his tent in the warehouse area.
[NPC] Brintec: Are you interested in this simple errand?
[NPC Internal] I'll take it.
[NPC] Brintec: All right.
[NPC] Brintec: Let me know when you find something out.

[To] Bjorid Haakthir

[NPC Internal] Brintec wants the carpets.
[NPC] Bjorid: Oh, Brintec wants them, does he?
[NPC] Bjorid: And when he sent you here, did he at least give you the dye I need to finish the order?
[NPC] Bjorid: So many blue carpets.
[NPC] Bjorid: I used all the blue dye I had and it still wasn't enough.
[NPC] Bjorid: Brintec promised that he'd send me another bottle, but it seems that he's forgotten all about it.
[NPC] Bjorid: Tell him I need the blue dye first before I can finish these carpets.

[To] Brintec Dev-Onni

[NPC Internal] Bjorid needs the blue dye to complete the order.
[NPC] Brintec: Blue dye?
[NPC] Brintec: I thought I sent someâ€¦
[NPC] Brintec: Brintec Dev-Onni notices a bottle of blue dye sitting next to him.
[NPC] Brintec: Ah, I see now!
[NPC] Brintec: I completely forgot to send it to him!
[NPC] Brintec: It seems this errand, so dull at first, is becoming more interesting, isn't it?
[NPC] Brintec: But let's not lose any more precious time!
[NPC] Brintec: Please make haste and give him this bottle so he can send me the carpets as soon as possible!

[To] Bjorid Haakthir

[NPC Internal] [YOU give Bjorid the dye.]
[NPC] Bjorid: Now that's more like it!
[NPC] Bjorid: Yes, now I can continue my work.
[NPC] Bjorid: Give this scroll to Brintec: it contains payment and delivery date information.

[To] Brintec Dev-Onni

[NPC Internal] Here is the delivery date information.
[NPC] Brintec: Aha, yes.
[NPC] Brintec: We should be able to fill the order in time.
[NPC] Brintec: Thank you for your help; here's a little reward.
