[To] Vaieund

[NPC Internal] I'm looking for a quest!
[NPC] Vaieund: Hail Stonehammer.
[NPC] Vaieund: A quest eh?
[NPC] Vaieund: I do not know if I have anything grand for you to do, but there is something I want.
[NPC] Vaieund: Meoeor and I play Octarch's chess often and I have heard word that Jayose has penned a strategy guide that might help me to keep my edge.
[NPC] Vaieund: Go to Hydlaa and find me a copy of this book and return.
[NPC] Vaieund: If you can handle this, I will pay you more than fairly; I have quite a bit saved up from me adventuring days.
[NPC] Vaieund: Do you accept the job?
[NPC Internal] Yes, I can go and see him next time Iâ€™m in Hydlaa.
[NPC] Vaieund: Wonderful.
[NPC] Vaieund: I would start at Jayose's if I were you.

[To] Jayose

[NPC Internal] Vaieund sent me to get a book of strategy on Octarch's chess.
[NPC] Jayose: I truly wish I had one to sell, but you see the one copy I did have disappeared before I could have my scribes make more.
[NPC] Jayose: I do not really have the time to go looking for it.
[NPC] Jayose: Maybe you would have some luck in tracking it down.
[NPC] Jayose: Ask some of the folks here in the library if they have heard anything.
[NPC] Jayose: If you can track down the missing book and return it, I will give you a reward and make a copy of the book for you.
[NPC] Jayose: Can you handle that?
[NPC Internal] Yes.
[NPC] Jayose: Excellent.
[NPC] Jayose: Ask my assistant Lori Tryllyn about a missing book.
[NPC] Jayose: She's upstairs.

[To] Lori Tryllyn

[NPC Internal] What can you tell me about the Octarch's chess strategy book?
[NPC] Lori: You're looking for that book too?
[NPC] Lori: I work here, and I scribe the copies for Jayose.
[NPC] Lori: The old coot probably set it down somewhere and forgot it.
[NPC] Lori: Maybe you could ask Durok Rrecrok; just tell kra I sent you or ask kra about any strange people in the library.
[NPC] Lori: Durok is probably downstairs.

[To] Durok Rrecrok

[NPC Internal] Lori sent me to ask you about the strange people?
[NPC] Durok: Looking for that book, too?
[NPC] Durok: I cannot say I have seen it, but I do think I saw a dodgy character in here about the time it went missing.
[NPC] Durok: There are always tournaments of Octarch's chess and sometimes there are prizes for winning.
[NPC] Durok: It might actually be worth stealing for those reasons.
[NPC] Durok: I would ask Terea Lohdren.
[NPC] Durok: She was visiting the library at about the time the book went missing.
[NPC] Durok: I saw this shady man and I think she got a better look at him.
[NPC] Durok: Just tell her I sent you or ask her about the dodgy fellow.

[To] Terea Lohdren

[NPC Internal] Can you tell me about that dodgy fellow you saw?
[NPC] Terea: Ah, yes, Durok told me a book came up missing.
[NPC] Terea: That explains a lot.
[NPC] Terea: I saw a man who looked very much like he was of poor character in the library, so of course I was curious.
[NPC] Terea: He only stayed a moment before leaving hurriedly.
[NPC] Terea: I let him leave, but soon I decided to follow him.
[NPC] Terea: He left the library district and headed toward the Laanx temple.
[NPC] Terea: He snuck past Menlil and Sharven and jumped into the well.
[NPC] Terea: I'm not so crazy to jump down there, so this is where I lost him.
[NPC] Terea: I bet whoever this person is, he is hiding out somewhere in the Laanx dungeon.
[NPC] Terea: If you find a shady looking man, just ask him directly about the Octarch's chess book or tell him I saw him.

[To] Zak

[NPC Internal] Tell me about the Octarch's chess book.
[NPC] Zak: I knew that Talad follower was trouble.
[NPC] Zak: All right, look, you have enough to cast suspicion on me, but there are no guards down here to help you.
[NPC] Zak: If you want the book back, you have to do something for me.
[NPC] Zak: I came across this bottle of Carrion Crawler Larvae, only I do not know what it does, so I do not know who to try to sell it to.
[NPC] Zak: If you can, find out what it is used for and return and tell me.
[NPC] Zak: I'll help you then and only then.
[NPC Internal] clean infectious wounds
[NPC] Zak: Good good, the larvae will have some value then.
[NPC] Zak: I have copied the most important parts of the book in the meanwhile, so I don't need it anymore.
[NPC] Zak: Here you go.
[NPC] Zak: In Yliakum, it is often wise to mind one's own business.

[To] Jayose

[NPC Internal] gives the book of Octarch's chess strategy to Jayose.
[NPC] Jayose: Nicely done.
[NPC] Jayose: Now to make you a copy.
[NPC Narrate] -Jayose takes out a blank book and a glyph and begins an incantation.-
[NPC] Jayose: Oh grains of time, save me mine and write this book for me.
[NPC] Jayose: My pen hand is sore, and evermore, you score the page with glee.
[NPC Narrate] -One of the quills on the desk animates, and the book is quickly copied.-
[NPC] Jayose: Yes, there we have it.
[NPC] Jayose: Here is your copy.
[NPC] Jayose: Goodbye and good luck.

[To] Vaieund

[NPC Internal] Here is your copy of the stratgy book.
[NPC] Vaieund: Nicely done.
[NPC] Vaieund: Now Meoeor will never have a chance at the tournament.
[NPC] Vaieund: Thanks and here is something special for you.
[NPC] Vaieund: I do not know what it is for but it certainly looks important.
[NPC] Vaieund: Farewell!
