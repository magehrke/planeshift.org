[To] Reffitia Thamal

[NPC Internal] I would like to train under you as your cooking apprentice.
[NPC] Reffitia: Wellâ€¦
[NPC Narrate] -Reffitia looks you up and down.-
[NPC] Reffitia: Hmmmm.
[NPC] Reffitia: If you want to be my apprentice, I'm going to have to test your skills a bit.
[NPC] Reffitia: Are you up for it?
[NPC Internal] Sure, I am ready for the test, what must I do?
[NPC] Reffitia: If you have come to me, I assume you already have some cooking and baking skill.
[NPC] Reffitia: I take it you have worked with the Gerpleferds and perhaps Jomed in Hydlaa?
[NPC] Reffitia: So I'll offer you a set of choices.
[NPC] Reffitia: First, would you rather make something from the Meats and Stews recipe book or The Pastry Chef Book?
[NPC Internal] I'll make something from Meats and Stews.
[NPC] Reffitia: Alright, then.
[NPC] Reffitia: I know the recipes by heart so I'll give you a choice between Hearty Irifon Rice, Savory Kikiri Stew, or a Meat And Egg Omelette.
[NPC] Reffitia: I'm not going to walk you through it, you'll need to figure out the recipe on your own if you've never made those.
[NPC] Reffitia: That is all part of the test.
[NPC] Reffitia: That and, of course, how it tastes.
[NPC Narrate] -Reffitia gives you a sheepish grin.-
[NPC] Reffitia: Make me one of those and make do your best!

[Info] Make whatever dish you want (e.g. Meat And Egg Omelette) and give it to Reffitia.
