[To] Jardet Forsill

[NPC Internal] I am here to be tested, here is my wand as prove of being a worthy student.
[NPC] Jardet: Good, I see you are ready for your test.
[NPC] Jardet: I like a hard worker!
[NPC Narrate] -Jardet nods, proudly.-
[NPC] Jardet: I want to check your ability.
[NPC] Jardet: Go and find some Tefusang Skin.
[NPC] Jardet: You can kill Tefusang and bring me their skin, otherwise you can buy them from someone, or you can recruit some good guy and go with him to kill Tefusangs.
[NPC Narrate] -Jardet thinks a little bit.-
[NPC] Jardet: Nothing too hard, let's say two Tefusang Skin.
[NPC] Jardet: I'll wait you here.
[NPC Internal] I found two Tefusang Skin, as you asked.
[NPC] Jardet: Very, very nice.
[NPC] Jardet: Now let me think.
[NPC Narrate] -Jardet taps his chin with his finger, then snaps the fingers.-
[NPC] Jardet: I know, hand me the glyph that increases the weight of the target's equipment.
[NPC Narrate] -Jardet awaits the glyph.-
[NPC Internal] I would think it would be â€¦ Weight?
[NPC Narrate] -Jardet nods.-
[NPC] Jardet: Well done.
[NPC Narrate] -Jardet returns your glyph.-
[NPC] Jardet: Even though up until now you have been thought or tested on single glyph spells, it is worth noting that Brown Way only have a few of those.
[NPC] Jardet: Most of our spells are derived from combining two glyphs in the correct order.
[NPC] Jardet: We will require Summon and Rock for our next session.
[NPC] Jardet: Do you have both these glyphs?
[NPC Internal] Yes, I am prepared.
[NPC] Jardet: Good, here is your bracers to prove you have passed this section of the training.
[NPC] Jardet: Come back to me and give me your wand when you're ready for the next lesson.
[NPC] Jardet: Of course, I will be the judge on if you are worthy yet.
[NPC] Jardet: If I don't take your wand, then you are not ready yet.
[NPC] Jardet: And for another test I request you go and see Gregori in the arena, he needs your help.
