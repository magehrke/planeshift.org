[NPC Internal] Hail soldier, can I assist you in tasks?

[NPC] Roobelh: Staring out over this expanse and nothing ever happens, you know?
[NPC] Roobelh: But I can't move from my spot, so how about you do me a favour, huh?
[NPC Internal] Alright, I'll help you.
[NPC] Roobelh: Good good.
[NPC] Roobelh: I asked Yonda Axebow to make me a special wooden toy.
[NPC] Roobelh: So you gotta let Yonda know that Roobelh sent you.

[NPC] Roobelh: You're a pal.

[NPC] Yonda: Here, take it.
[NPC] Yonda: Get it to him as fast as you can.
[NPC] Yonda: Custom toys are paid for in advance, so don't worry about that.
