[NPC] Oriven: It's also a matter of knowledge.
[NPC] Oriven: It's time to learn something.

[NPC] Oriven: I was there and I didn't like to be bullied, neither by a god nor by man.
[NPC] Oriven: But enough.
[NPC] Oriven: What did Londris remembered when the winds start to rise?
[NPC Internal] eclipse
[NPC] Oriven: Yes.
[NPC] Oriven: A really strange book, isn't it?
[NPC Narrate] -Oriven closes his eyes for a moment.-
[NPC] Oriven: Now hand me the glyph that weakens your foe.
[NPC Internal] I guess that will be Weakness?
[NPC Narrate] -Oriven nods.-
[NPC] Oriven: So you are not a complete waste of skin.
[NPC Narrate] -Oriven returns your glyph.-
[NPC] Oriven: Now hand me the glyph that allows you to cast a spell that reduces vision.
[NPC Narrate] -Oriven once again awaits your glyph.-
[NPC Internal] And who can see in the Darkness of night right?
