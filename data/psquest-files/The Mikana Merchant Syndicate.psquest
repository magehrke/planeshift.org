[To] Jirosh Mikana

[NPC Internal] Hello again Jirosh.
[NPC] Jirosh: Ah, YOU.
[NPC Narrate] -Jirosh finishes scribbling on a piece of paper as he curses under his breath before looking up.-
[NPC] Jirosh: So, straight to the point.
[NPC] Jirosh: I'm really busy at the moment as I'm planning to create a merchant syndicate, how would you like to help me?
[NPC] Jirosh: My syndicate will be dedicated to fair market prices, expedience in delivery and ease in getting people all over Yliakum exactly the items they want.
[NPC] Jirosh: This is in contradiction to other syndicates, like Thorian's, which I'm sure he won't like and won't let you work for if you help me.
[NPC Narrate] -Jirosh puts his pen down and spreads his hands open welcomingly.-
[NPC] Jirosh: If you can get me five yellow merchant seals, I can give you papers to get you into the Hydlaa winch as a representative of the Mikana Trading Company.
[NPC] Jirosh: Would you try for me?
[NPC] Jirosh: You'll want to see my brother Phanejor when you're there.
[NPC Internal] Yes, I can do that for you.
[NPC] Jirosh: Thank you, tabei.
[NPC] Jirosh: I will be here waiting for the five yellow seals.
[NPC] Jirosh: I want you to be honest with the merchants; get the seals fairly.
[NPC] Jirosh: No tricks please.
[NPC] Jirosh: Good luck and Talad's blessing.

[NPC Internal] Yes, the yellow seal for Jirosh will be perfect.
[NPC] Toda: Then take this with my humble thanks, tabei.

[NPC] Jeyarp: Ah, quite so.
[NPC] Jeyarp: This is for you.
[NPC] Jeyarp: Thank you.
[NPC] Jeyarp: Speak to my wife as well; she has a personal seal too.

[To] Gayla Grotemey

[NPC Internal] Your husband suggested I ask you about joining a Syndicate.
[NPC Narrate] -Gayla smiles as she looks at you.-
[NPC] Gayla: Well, if he said that you must be here for Jirosh?
[NPC Internal] That's right, I am. Are you interested in joining his syndicate?
[NPC] Gayla: I certainly am, here, you can have this yellow seal to take to him.

[To] Jirosh Mikana

[NPC Internal] I collected all the seals you need.
[NPC] Jirosh: One thousand thanks, tabei.
[NPC] Jirosh: Did you manage to get any more than were required?
[NPC] Jirosh: If so you can hand them to me now.
[NPC Internal] Yes I did.
[NPC] Jirosh: Have a small reward for your extra effort.
[NPC] Jirosh: Was it just this one?
[NPC Internal] Yes, just the one extra.
[NPC] Jirosh: Then thank you.
[NPC] Jirosh: The Mikana Company will become stronger than ever, and Yliakum's access to goods will be even easier with this new alliance.
[NPC] Jirosh: I name you as our representative, so please take these access papers.
[NPC] Jirosh: Give them to the guard in Hydlaa who is in front of the winch doors.
[NPC] Jirosh: I know not his name.
[NPC] Jirosh: His memory is good so once presented, you will always be allowed in the Hydlaa Winch area.
[NPC] Jirosh: Farewell.
