[NPC] Murago: I have another task for you.

[NPC Internal] I've got some free time, how can I help?
[NPC] Murago: That's the spirit.
[NPC] Murago: Kindly deliver this message to the Shrine of Talad in Dsar Sarraghi.

[NPC] Murago: She can help you if you require it.

[To] Tarela Girshon

[NPC Internal] Hi Tarela, Murago said you would be able to deliver a message to Dsar Sarraghi.
[NPC] Tarela: May I see the message?
[NPC Narrate] -Tarela holds out a paw.-
[NPC Internal] gives Tarela the message.
[NPC] Tarela: I see.
[NPC] Tarela: Dsar Sarraghi is currently quarantined.
[NPC] Tarela: I can't possibly get through.
[NPC] Tarela: Unlessâ€¦
[NPC] Tarela: I have a lockbox containing an Azure Way glyph that will grant me the gift of stealth.
[NPC] Tarela: I may be able to enter the Dsar undetected with this glyph.
[NPC] Tarela: I'm holding the box at the Mikana mercantile company.
[NPC] Tarela: Tell Jirosh that Talera sent you.
[NPC] Tarela: I'm taking a big risk at contracting whatever sickness is inside the dsar, but Murago Puntjal pays well so I will do it.

[To] Jirosh Mikana

[NPC Internal] Greetings Jirosh, I was sent by Tarela to pick up her lockbox.
[NPC] Jirosh: I was wondering when she would claim her mysterious box.
[NPC] Jirosh: Allow me to collect it.
[NPC Narrate] -Jirosh bends down and searches through various boxes. He stands back up with a worry on his face.-
[NPC] Jirosh: It's gone!
[NPC] Jirosh: I accidentally sent it out on a caravan.
[NPC] Jirosh: My records indicate they were placed on a caravan belonging to one Taemian Yangnk.
[NPC] Jirosh: Find him, and get that lockbox back.
[NPC] Jirosh: I'm really sorry about this.

[To] Taemian Yangnk

[NPC Internal] Hello, you got a lockbox mistakenly in your inventory, it belongs to me.
[NPC] Taemian: Oh right, this box that didn't appear on the Mikana company invoice and that I didn't ask for.
[NPC] Taemian: I couldn't figure out how to open it.
[NPC] Taemian: An adventurer named Vaieund offered me a key that might open it in exchange for getting him some book?
[NPC] Taemian: Bah, who has time for that?
[NPC] Taemian: Anyway, I can't ever give away anything for free, so how about something to wet my beard?
[NPC] Taemian: Some red liquor oughta do just fine.
[NPC] Taemian: How's about a mugful?
[NPC Internal] Here is your red liquor, now give me my box.
[NPC Narrate] -Taemian guzzles the contents of the mug, then wipes his mouth with his sleeve, beard still dripping.-
[NPC] Taemian: Ahhh.
[NPC] Taemian: That'll make yer waterwheel churn.
[NPC] Taemian: Here's the lockbox.
[NPC] Taemian: Do with it what you will.

[To] Tarela Girshon

[NPC Internal] I have your lockbox.
[NPC] Tarela: What took you so long?
[NPC Narrate] -Tarela produces a key and opens the lockbox. You can't see inside it, but her face is bathed in a light blue glow. She closes the box.-
[NPC] Tarela: Yes, this will do.
[NPC] Tarela: Rest assured the Shrine of Talad will receive this message.
[NPC] Tarela: Tell Murago that he can pay me tomorrow or speak to him about paying me tomorrow.
[NPC] Tarela: Go quickly!
[NPC] Tarela: I will need to make haste myself.

[To] Murago Puntjal

[NPC Internal] You can pay Tarela tomorrow for the delivery.
[NPC] Murago: That means it is as good as sent.
[NPC] Murago: Such a trustworthy emissary, she is.
[NPC] Murago: While I await their response, take this and go with Talad.
