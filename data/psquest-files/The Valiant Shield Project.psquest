[To] Harnquist

[NPC Internal] Hello, Harnquist, what are you doing?
[NPC] Harnquist: What am I doing?
[NPC] Harnquist: Well, well, wellâ€¦now that's an interesting question.
[NPC Narrate] -Harnquist grins a bit and chuckles, shaking his head.-
[NPC] Harnquist: Nevermind, I'm messing with you.
[NPC] Harnquist: I wrote a manual about crafting a special shield, a nice one.
[NPC] Harnquist: Would you like to know more?
[NPC Internal] Sure! Let's hear it.
[NPC] Harnquist: That's a good choice.
[NPC] Harnquist: Look, I'm working on a Valiant Shield, and I'd love to teach you a bit about it.
[NPC] Harnquist: But you'll need some steel first.
[NPC] Harnquist: Go and get thirty ingots.
[NPC] Harnquist: That's right, thirty.
[NPC] Harnquist: If you have stock, melt them and recast into ingots.
[NPC] Harnquist: I'll be waiting here.
[NPC Internal] I've got the steel, and now?
[NPC] Harnquist: Now, now is when the fun begins.
[NPC] Harnquist: Heat some ingots up in the forge, not too much, and make a pair of good bands.
[NPC] Harnquist: To do this, you'll need a few lessons in blacksmithing.
[NPC] Harnquist: I will train you for that.
[NPC] Harnquist: Once you are skilled enough, you can make bands yourself.
[NPC] Harnquist: You'll also need a good amount of skill in shield making.
[NPC] Harnquist: Trasok Starhammer in Ojaveda can train you for that.
[NPC] Harnquist: If you already have these skills, for now you can use a Catalog of Shields to help you do this.
[NPC] Harnquist: So, you take seven heated ingots and hammer them using the anvil into three shield bands.
[NPC] Harnquist: Present them to me once you're done.
[NPC] Harnquist: Remember, you'll need two for this task but seven ingots makes three bands.
[NPC] Harnquist: One thing you'll find as a shield crafter is you can make many of these parts then use them as needed.
[NPC Narrate] -You make 3 Shield Bands.-
[NPC Internal] Am I doing it right?
[NPC] Harnquist: Pretty good.
[NPC] Harnquist: Now you should get two edgings.
[NPC] Harnquist: For this, you'll need thirteen ingots.
[NPC] Harnquist: That will make four edgings.
[NPC] Harnquist: Again, heat the ingots then hammer them at the anvil.
[NPC] Harnquist: Shouldn't be hard for you, huh?
[NPC] Harnquist: Come on, I will wait for you.
[NPC Narrate] -You make 4 Edgings.-
[NPC Internal] And here I present you the edgings.
[NPC] Harnquist: Nicely done, YOU.
[NPC] Harnquist: The last thing you'll need will be a shield shape.
[NPC] Harnquist: Make one using ten ingots and then come back to me so I can tell you how to finish your Valiant shield.
[NPC Narrate] -You make a Shield Shape.-
[NPC Internal] Here's the shape. Do I need anything else?
[NPC] Harnquist: Good!
[NPC] Harnquist: Now, have these.
[NPC Narrate] -Harnquist hands you a wooden piece and a handle.-
[NPC] Harnquist: This is a shield core and handle.
[NPC] Harnquist: The core holds all the parts of the shield together.
[NPC] Harnquist: I don't normally sell either of these but I happen to have a few on hand.
[NPC] Harnquist: Check with other smiths when you want to stock up on some.
[NPC] Harnquist: If you make shields on a regular basis, it's a good practice to keep a good amount of such supplies handy.
[NPC] Harnquist: Now you use the preparation table to take two bands, two edgings, handle, shape, and core and combine them to a Valiant Shield Kit.
[NPC] Harnquist: Then hold the kit and use the riveter to put it together.
[NPC] Harnquist: Have this book so you will remember the process in the future.
