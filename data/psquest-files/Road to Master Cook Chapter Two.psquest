[To] Mirra Houphen

[NPC Internal] Hi Mirra, any new recipes?
[NPC] Mirra: You're back!
[NPC] Mirra: That Sarraghi Steak was so tasty, I tried the recipe with other meats but nothing was as tasty as the marrow from the tefusang claws.
[NPC] Mirra: I never would have guessed that was the secret ingredient!
[NPC] Mirra: However it took forever to extract the marrow, because I don't have a proper butcher knife.
[NPC] Mirra: The presentation wasn't there either, since I only had my usual wooden bowls.
[NPC] Mirra: It would look so great on a silver plate!
[NPC] Mirra: Do you think you could run some more errands for me?
[NPC Internal] For you, any time. What do you need?
[NPC] Mirra: The taste of the food is most important, but the eye needs to be pleased as well!
[NPC] Mirra: Harnquist has a Butcher Knife for me, and Jirosh in Ojaveda has some silver plates.
[NPC] Mirra: Here, take these orders.
[NPC] Mirra: They will be expecting these.

[To] Harnquist

[NPC Internal] gives Harnquist the order.
[NPC] Harnquist: Ah, I see..
[NPC] Harnquist: a butcher knife?
[NPC] Harnquist: That should be easy enough.
[NPC] Harnquist: Now, I could get you a discount if you do a little something for me.
[NPC] Harnquist: Are you interested?
[NPC Internal] Sure, what must I do?
[NPC] Harnquist: Restock me with some iron ore.
[NPC] Harnquist: Four pieces should do.
[NPC Internal] Here's your iron ore.
[NPC] Harnquist: Great!
[NPC] Harnquist: You did a good job.
[NPC] Harnquist: These are some fine ores.
[NPC] Harnquist: Here is your butcher knife.
[NPC] Harnquist: It is yours as thanks for helping me out.

[To] Jirosh Mikana

[NPC Internal] gives Jirosh the order.
[NPC Narrate] -Jirosh takes the order and reads it.-
[NPC] Jirosh: Five silver platesâ€¦
[NPC] Jirosh: Got about six dozen of them stored in the warehouse but I don't have any buyers at all.
[NPC] Jirosh: I thought they would sell, but no one seems interested.
[NPC] Jirosh: Let's say one hundred tria per plate and I'm a happy Enkidukai.
[NPC Internal] Here's your money.
[NPC] Jirosh: Thank you, and here are your Silver Plates, Sir.

[To] Mirra Houphen

[NPC Internal] gives Mirra the knife and silver plates.
[NPC] Mirra: These are just what I needed, the proper tools for a master cook!
[NPC] Mirra: Thanks again, YOU.
[NPC] Mirra: Now let's see, the knife should have been around eighty tria, and the plates usually run for about two hundred tria a piece, so six circles should cover the expenses plus a little extra for you.
[NPC Narrate] -Mirra hands you a few coins.-
[NPC] Mirra: Come back soon, YOU.
