[Need] Nothing

[To] Jirosh Mikana

[NPC Internal] Is there something I can help with?
[NPC] Jirosh: Hmmâ€¦While I don't particularly need aid right now, it would make my work somewhat easier if you could perform a small service.
[NPC] Jirosh: I'm expecting a shipment, but have yet to receive it.
[NPC] Jirosh: If you could go and see if it has arrived, I'll grant you a fee for your troubles.
[NPC Internal] Sure, where do I go?
[NPC] Jirosh: Thanks.
[NPC] Jirosh: Here's a list of what I need.
[NPC] Jirosh: Give this to Merrinez.

[To] Merrinez Dholant

[NPC Internal] I am looking for this shipment.
[NPC] Merrinez: Not another inquiry into shipments.
[NPC Narrate] -Merrinez reads the shipping invoice, squinting his eyes as he does so.-
[NPC] Merrinez: Oh my aching head!
[NPC] Merrinez: The handwriting here is simply dreadful.
[NPC] Merrinez: Yes, yes, we have that crate, it just came in.
[NPC] Merrinez: Take it now so I don't have to look at this scrawling any longer!

[To] Jirosh Mikana

[NPC Internal] Here is your shipment.
[NPC] Jirosh: It had arrived?
[NPC] Jirosh: Oh good.
[NPC] Jirosh: Jellied Clacker Eyes are considered a delicacy by some of the more affluent of our citizens, not that I'd ever touch them.
[NPC] Jirosh: But if they are willing to pay hordes of money for it, what do I care?
[NPC] Jirosh: Here, have this with my thanks.

[Reward] [Money] 1297; [XP] 9400
