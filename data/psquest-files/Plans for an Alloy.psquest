[To] Shiu Hri

[NPC Internal] Hi, you seem deep in thought, anything I can help with?
[NPC] Shiu: I have come to import metals for the lower levels, and am looking for the base metals of an alloy.
[NPC] Shiu: Can you help me?
[NPC Internal] Now that, I can help you with.
[NPC] Shiu: I appreciate it greatly.
[NPC] Shiu: First, I understand that if you exit Hydlaa by the gate that my friend Finara Plund is guarding, nearby you will find some stalactites that have fallen point-down in the ground.
[NPC] Shiu: They are in fact rich in copper ore.
[NPC] Shiu: I require six pieces.
[NPC] Shiu: This number is very important.
[NPC] Shiu: Return to me with them and I'll give you the next requirement.
[NPC Internal] Six copper ore as requested.
[NPC] Shiu: You, Sir, are a wonder.
[NPC] Shiu: Now, just before Dsar Akkaio lies a river.
[NPC] Shiu: The spirits of nature have arranged it just so a metal ore is washed toward and collects around the rocks.
[NPC] Shiu: This metal is known as tin.
[NPC] Shiu: I implore you, dig around the large rock by this river and find me four pieces of this tin ore.
[NPC] Shiu: Four.
[NPC] Shiu: I will be waiting.
[NPC Internal] hands Shiu the four tin ore.
[NPC] Shiu: Marvellous!
[NPC] Shiu: Thank you, Sir, thank you!
[NPC] Shiu: This alloy is invaluable to the Nolthrir people.
[NPC] Shiu: If you knowâ€¦tell me the name of this alloy, please?
[NPC Internal] bronze
[NPC] Shiu: Bronze.
[NPC] Shiu: You must be an expert at metallurgy.
[NPC] Shiu: Very well, I prefer trading with people who know their materials.
[NPC] Shiu: In exchange for this bronze I present these armored pants.
[NPC] Shiu: I traded for these earlier, but have decided an underwater people would have little use for them.
[NPC] Shiu: Consider it a fair trade for the ores.
[NPC] Shiu: Farewell.
