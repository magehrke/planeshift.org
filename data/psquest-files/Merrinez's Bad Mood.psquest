[To] Merrinez Dholant

[NPC Internal] Do you have a task for me?
[NPC] Merrinez: Humph.
[NPC] Merrinez: I work days and nights in the warehouse, and now some snipper wants me to set him some silly task, just so I can give away my hard earned wealth?
[NPC] Merrinez: I have no need to feel important by employing people.
[NPC] Merrinez: My only problem is that my work is too hard.
[NPC Internal] Tell me about your problem.
[NPC] Merrinez: The main problem is the physical work.
[NPC] Merrinez: I've nearly ruined my paws with all this loading and unloading of giant boxes.
[NPC] Merrinez: The working hours here are also too long, so I can get little rest.
[NPC] Merrinez: At least the pay is good; otherwise, I wouldn't be here right now!
[NPC] Merrinez: Anyway, I don't think you can do anything for me.
[NPC] Merrinez: Goodbye.
[NPC Internal] This might help your hands.
[NPC] Merrinez: Hey, what's thisâ€¦
[NPC] Merrinez: gloves?
[NPC] Merrinez: This is very kind of you.
[NPC] Merrinez: They're so soft and precious!
[NPC] Merrinez: I've never thought about gloves, but they can probably ease my work.
[NPC] Merrinez: At least my hands will not be ruined!
[NPC] Merrinez: Thanks.
[NPC] Merrinez: I have to repay you for your help, so take this reward.
