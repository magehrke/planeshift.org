                                                  Especially the quests are in a better shape now, especially the <a href="/quests/repeatable-quests.php">
                                                  repeatable quests</a> section has quite improved. All of this

However, over the years not only guild intern members, but also non-guild members contributed vast amounts of data. Because of that and because I think the few players left should support each other as much as possible, I opened all sections and moved the site with a new name to a new domain. If you have any suggestions or want to contribute, please send me a message. Best of luck, Huarwar.

                                                <p>I have done a lot in the past 2 weeks. I started to add all the quests again to the page. These quests are done by me and a program I wrote translates them so a browser can display it correctly. The program is still growing, but I started to add the first 8 Quests. I have to actually do them In Game to be able to add them, so please be patient. Because of this, we now have 2 Quest sections. One <a href="/quests/quests-new.php">Quests (New)</a> section, where you can find the new quests and one <a href="/quests/quests.php">Quests</a> section, where you can find the old 385 quest logs. I would suggest looking for the information you need under the new <a href="/quests/quests-new.php">Quests (New)</a> tab and if you don't find the quest, consulting the <a href="/quests/quests.php">Quests</a> tab.

You can find the site under the guild tab, <a href="/guild/guildranks.php">here</a>. Lots of thanks also to Eatuck who send me the information including the layout!

                                                    Hello everyone. Today I added a page counter. Ok, i even added two. So the first one counts the total visits of the planeshift.org page and the second one counts the visit of different ip-addresses (closest thing to people). At the moment the counters are under the <a href="/">Home Section</a> and not as beautiful as I would like it to be. If you have an idea where to place it and how to change the style, please tell me. Fine. Let's see how much our site is in use. Take care and see you in game, Huarwar.

                                                    Hello everyone. Today I added a <a href="/trainers/trainingcalculator.php">Training Calculator</a>. I think it is especially helpful for newbies, knowing what they need for leveling up stats. Training it faster. But even if you have maxed all your stats, please make sure to check it out! This is it for now, take care and see you in game, Huarwar.

                                                    Hello everyone, it's me again. I just added two new sections under the guild tab. The first is <a href="/more/nefasentrance.php">Nefas Entrance</a> and the second is <a href="/more/grendolcave.php">Grendol Cave</a> (click on the names to go direeeeeectly to the sections). Both show solutions for the respective problem, so in the future you do not have to worry anymore going into the skull cave.</p>
                                                    <p>Great thanks this time to Lingwelli, who provided the information and did all the pictures. He additionally provided informations about how to get out of the lava cave (<a href="/more/lavacaveexit.php">Lava Cave Exit</a>), which is already online for several month. You can find this peace of information also under the guild tab. Again a big thank you (and hug) for this contribution to Lingwelli. This is it for now, take care and see you in game, Huarwar.

                                                    Hello everyone. I (Huaaaaaaaarwar) am currently working on the website again. I did a few changes. First, there is no changelog anymore at the Landingpage. To compensate this and to get to use this section right here, I will write little updates right here from time to time. In the long run, this section shall also be used for other information purposes. I hope at some point I will have the time to program a frontend for other members, to post stuff here. Second, there is a new site. Hurraaay! It's called Gem Enchanting and you will find it under the magic tab or if you click on this link: <a href="/magic/gemenchanting.php" target="blank">Yeah, I can finally look up gem enchanting</a>.</p>
                                                    <p>Great Thanks to Eatuck, who took a lot of time, to provide all the information. Without him, the section would not exist. This is it for now, take care and see you in game, Huarwar.
                                                </p>

                                                <p> Welcome to our new Guild Website. It is still under construction, but if you can already find useful information, please help yourself. There are most probably lots of mistakes and I do not claim completeness. Please contact me and tell me what you like or don't like about the website. Don't hesitate, most of the changes are simple and fast. I hope you like the site. Enjoy.</p>
                                                 <p> For the content we all have to contribute our experience and information we collect during playing. Just send me an E-Mail. Adding information is my job and my participation to the guild, so please contact me if you have anything which should be put online.</p>
